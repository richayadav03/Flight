# Flight
This project is a creative and visually engaging web experiment crafted solely with HTML and CSS. It showcases a dynamic runway created using various CSS commands. The runway, initially fully visible, gradually vanishes as the user interacts with it using the mouse-pointer, whether it's clicked on the left or right side. This intriguing effect adds an element of interactivity and visual intrigue to the project, making it a fun and memorable web experience.
